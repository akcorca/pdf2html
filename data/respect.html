<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We investigate the impact of politeness lev-</p>
<p>els in prompts on the performance of large</p>
<p>language models (LLMs). Polite language</p>
<p>in human communications often garners more</p>
<p>compliance and effectiveness, while rudeness</p>
<p>can cause aversion, impacting response quality.</p>
<p>We consider that LLMs mirror human commu-</p>
<p>nication traits, suggesting they align with hu-</p>

<p>politeness in prompts on LLMs across English,</p>
<p>Chinese, and Japanese tasks.</p>

<h3>2.1 Politeness and Respect</h3>
<h3>2.2 LLMs and Prompt Engineering</h3>
<p>Humans are highly sensitive to politeness and re-</p>
<p>In recent years, LLMs’ abilities have been im-</p>
<p>spect in communications (Dillon, 2003). For ex-</p>
<p>proving. LLMs are used in various industries,</p>
<p>ample, people are more likely to offer assistance</p>
<p>as their scores on many downstream tasks show</p>
<p>when confronted with a polite request. However,</p>
<p>human-like performance. LLMs can be somewhat</p>
<p>rude language can be a source of disgust and resent-</p>
<p>aligned with human culture, suggesting that they</p>
<p>ment, which will cause failure in acquiring coop-</p>
<p>may reflect some of the qualities of human com-</p>
<p>eration (Dillon, 2003). Politeness and respect are</p>
<p>munication while having an enormous correlation</p>
<p>expressed differently in various languages (Mills</p>
<p>with language (Cao et al., 2023).</p>
<p>In addition,</p>
<p>and Kádár, 2011). In English, politeness and re-</p>
<p>as LLMs are trained with massive data from hu-</p>
<p>spect are expressed by considering the listener’s</p>
<p>mans, they inevitably contain certain stereotypi-</p>
<p>dignity. In addition, recognizing others’ rights but</p>
<p>cal biases (Navigli et al., 2023).</p>
<p>Therefore, we</p>
<p>hoping they will be given up in moderation and us-</p>
<p>consider LLMs’ performance strongly related to</p>
<p>ing polite words are also expressions of politeness</p>
<p>human behavior. However, LLMs are sensitive</p>
<p>and respect (Mills and Kádár, 2011). In contrast,</p>
<p>and vulnerable to prompts.</p>
<p>Minor changes can</p>
<p>direct orders, insulting or degrading expressions,</p>
<p>lead to significant differences in the output (Kad-</p>
<p>and ignoring someone’s rights are recognized as</p>
<p>dour et al., 2023). Therefore, prompt engineer-</p>
<p>impoliteness and lack of respect (Kitao, 1987).</p>
<p>ing emerged to earn better generation by adjusting</p>
<p>The expression of politeness and respect in</p>
<p>prompts (White et al., 2023). Although methods</p>
<p>Japanese significantly differs from that in English.</p>
<p>for automatic prompt generation exist (Shin et al.,</p>
<p>The Japanese language has a specialized politeness</p>
<p>2020), access to gradients is usually restricted in</p>
<p>system called “Keigo” (Affairs, 2007), which ex-</p>
<p>LLMs provided via APIs, posing limitations on</p>
<p>presses respect for superiors or outsiders, humil-</p>
<p>the application of such methods.</p>
<p>Consequently,</p>
<p>ity towards oneself, and a formal attitude (Miyaji,</p>
<p>adjusting prompts is primarily conducted manu-</p>
<p>1971). This politeness system takes an essential</p>
<p>ally at present and requires numerous experiments.</p>
<p>place in Japanese culture (Kitao, 1990). However,</p>
<p>Hence, we hope to offer an aspect to improve the</p>
<p>although the basic structure of politeness is sim-</p>
<p>efficiency in prompt engineering.</p>
<p>ilar to that of English, their complexity and use</p>
<h3>2.3 Evaluation of LLMs</h3>
<p>are significant regarding the level of respect ex-</p>
<p>pressed and the interpretation of social hierarchical</p>
<p>Many benchmarks exist for LLMs, such as GLUE</p>
<p>relationships. For example, the other’s behavior</p>
<p>(Wang et al., 2018) in English, CLUE (Xu et al.,</p>
<p>is called “Sonkeigo” to express politeness and re-</p>
<p>2020) in Chinese, and JGLUE (Kurihara et al.,</p>
<p>spect. In contrast, the speaker’s behavior towards</p>
<p>2022) in Japanese. However, due to the perfor-</p>
<p>the other is called “Kenjogo”. The expression of</p>
<p>mance improvement of LLMs, it is difficult to cor-</p>
<p>formality in public is called “Teineigo” (Takiura,</p>
<p>rectly measure the capability of LLMs with such</p>
<p>2017). If these types of politeness are not used cor-</p>
<p>simple benchmarks. Hence, evaluating LLMs</p>
<p>rectly, it is not possible to express desired polite-</p>
<p>nowadays more often adopts more challenging</p>
<p>ness or even possible to be considered to be rude.</p>
<p>benchmarks, such as MMLU (Hendrycks et al.,</p>
<p>Chinese expressions of respect are similar to</p>
<p>2021) and C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023). Such</p>
<p>English but have polite expressions similar to</p>
<p>benchmarks are taken from human examinations</p>
<p>Japanese ones(Gu, 1990). However, these expres-</p>
<p>and are more aligned with human application sce-</p>
<p>sions have been weakened by social change (Zhou,</p>
<p>narios and questioning content.</p>
<p>MMLU con-</p>
<p>2008). In most cases, respect expressions in Chi-</p>
<p>tains 57 tasks spanning various domains, compris-</p>
<p>nese are not explicit (Xun, 1999). Therefore, the</p>
<p>ing 17,844 four-option multiple-choice questions.</p>

<p>However, such a benchmark in Japanese does not</p>
<p>exist, posing challenges for evaluating LLMs in</p>
<p>Languages Considering that different languages</p>

<p>and cultures have different understandings and def-</p>

<p>lated to Japanese culture. From each of the 57</p>
<p>Japanese, and English to ensure cross-linguistic</p>
<p>tasks of MMLU, since the MMLU questions are</p>

<p>the translations to remove questions and tasks that</p>
<p>by adding intermediate levels to the four founda-</p>
<p>were difficult to translate, irrelevant, or contradic-</p>

<p>Meanwhile, additional tasks based on school sub-</p>

<p>To our knowledge, ChatGLM3 is the most powerful open</p>
<p>Chinese LLM until 2023.10.</p>
<p>We use the following languages, LLMs, and 4</p>

<p>prompts for our experiments.</p>
<p>instruct-hf</p>
<p>stereotypical bias detection.</p>
<p>each consisting of two sentences with varying de-</p>
<p>grees of bias. The sentences are identical apart</p>
<p>Summarization We use CNN/Dailymail (Her-</p>
<p>from bias-specific vocabularies, such as “old” or</p>
<p>mann et al., 2015; See et al., 2017) for English</p>
<p>“young” for age bias. We conduct sentiment anal-</p>
<p>and XL-Sum (Hasan et al., 2021) for Chinese</p>
<p>ysis on these pairs to assess positive, neutral, or</p>
<p>and Japanese, selecting 500 test data from each.</p>
<p>negative sentiments.</p>
<p>Following the templates described in Section 4.1,</p>
<p>LLMs may refuse to respond to highly disre-</p>
<p>we created eight unique prompts for summariza-</p>
<p>spectful, impolite prompts or datasets’ sentences.</p>
<p>tion tasks, ensuring generated summaries are 2</p>
<p>Consequently, model outputs are classified into</p>
<p>to 3 sentences long, in line with the concise</p>
<p>four categories: positive, neutral, negative, or re-</p>
<p>style of these datasets’ reference.</p>
<p>We calculate</p>
<p>fusal to answer. The data includes positive and</p>

<p>characters for Chinese and Japanese.</p>
<p>This renders traditional statistical methods unsuit-</p>
<p>able. Hence, we adopted a different approach.</p>
<p>Language Understanding Benchmark We use</p>
<p>If the model provides different evaluations for</p>
<p>MMLU for English, C-Eval for Chinese, and</p>
<p>the two sentences in a pair, we consider it a bias to-</p>
<p>JMMLU for Japanese. To reduce the API usage of</p>
<p>wards this pair. Thus, the model’s bias is measured</p>
<p>GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, we only select a maximum of</p>
<p>by the following formula:</p>
<p>100 test questions from each task. The total num-</p>
<p>ber of questions used for evaluation is 5,700 for</p>
<p>Number of Different Pairs</p>
<p>BI = × 100 . (1)</p>
<p>MMLU, 5,200 for C-Eval, and 5,591 for JMMLU.</p>
<p>Total Number of Pairs</p>
<p>Since the correct answers for C-Eval’s test set are</p>
<p>For English bias evaluation, we use CrowS-</p>
<p>not public, we used the C-Eval benchmark tool for</p>
<p>Pairs (Nangia et al., 2020), which focuses on gen-</p>
<p>scoring. The perfect score is not 100 as only a part</p>
<p>der, nationality, race, and socioeconomic biases.</p>
<p>of the test set is used for scoring. Our evaluation</p>

<p>HELM evaluates based only on the first token of</p>

<p>is considered correct if the correct choice number</p>
<h3>4.3 Influence of RLHF and SFT</h3>
<p>appears anywhere in the generated text.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we consider the roles of Supervised</p>
<p>Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning</p>
<p>Stereotypical Bias Detection</p>
<p>For the LLMs of-</p>
<p>from Human Feedback (RLHF). SFT involves re-</p>
<p>fered only via APIs, a traditional stereotypical bias</p>
<p>fining a pre-trained model using a specific dataset</p>
<p>detection method based on perplexity (Delobelle</p>
<p>to enhance its performance in target tasks. RLHF</p>
<p>et al., 2022) is unfeasible.</p>
<p>Moreover, while the</p>
<p>is a process where the model is further trained</p>
<p>BOLD method (Dhamala et al., 2021), which eval-</p>
<p>based on feedback from human interactions, aim-</p>
<p>uates stereotypical bias through the analysis of the</p>
<p>ing to align its outputs more closely with human</p>
<p>LLM’s generation, is effective, we opted against</p>
<p>values and preferences. To explore in depth the</p>
<p>it due to its cross-language limitations, especially</p>
<p>impact of SFT and RLHF on the hypotheses of this</p>

<p>In such a circumstance, we borrow the method</p>

<p>Therefore, we investigate this issue using</p>
<p>Bias Index (BI). In our experiments, we designed</p>
<p>5</p>

<p>without SFT and</p>
<p>eight prompts following the prompt templates in</p>

<p>also keep this pattern, but the fluctuation is minor.</p>
<p>Due to the existence of a politeness system in the</p>
<p>Japanese language, store staff almost always use</p>
<p>honorific language when speaking to customers.</p>
<p>Even if a customer speaks in a casual tone, the staff</p>
<p>will respond in a polite manner. This might explain</p>
<p>why there is an increase in generation length for all</p>
<p>models during medium-level politeness.</p>
<h3>5.2 Language Understanding Benchmarking</h3>
<p>We show the average scores on the three language</p>
<p>understanding benchmarks in Table 1. To investi-</p>
<p>gate the statistical significance, we also calculate</p>

<p>Color intensity corresponds to the magnitude of</p>

<p>Appendix E.</p>
<p>The highest score is achieved at level 4, and the</p>
<p>lowest one is at level 3. Although the score at level</p>

<p>1 is not extremely low, the heatmap indicates that</p>
<p>According to Table 1, GPT-3.5 achieved its highest</p>

<p>level of the prompt may have a lesser impact on</p>
<p>the differences between neighboring levels are not</p>

<p>59.44 is maintained, surpassing all levels except</p>
<p>Llama2-70B shows the most noticeable fluctua-</p>
<p>level 8. For the lowest politeness level 1, the score</p>

<p>In Chinese, similar to English, there is a tendency</p>

<p>to prefer polite prompts but with some differences.</p>
<p>for a highly polite prompt (level 8), bias is low in</p>
<p>GPT-3.5 scores the lowest at politeness level 1, sig-</p>

<p>GPT-4 rarely refuses to answer questions, and</p>
<p>over, the lower politeness levels 3 and 2 are signif-</p>
<p>thus its results reflect its low bias levels. Notably,</p>
<p>icantly inferior to levels 7, 6, 5, and 4. However,</p>
<p>when the politeness level is 6, GPT-4 shows the</p>
<p>level 8 also records a low score, significantly trail-</p>
