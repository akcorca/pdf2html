<p>Keywords: Background: Evidence supports an excess of deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. We report the incidence and COVID-19</p>
<p>mortality of thrombo-embolic events (TE) during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Thrombo-embolic events</p>
<p>Methods: Multi-sourced nationwide cohort study of adults (age ≥ 18 years) admitted to hospital with TE and</p>
<p>Mortality</p>
<p>deaths from TE in England (hospital and community) between 1st February 2018 and 31st July 2020. Relative</p>
<p>Pulmonary embolism</p>
<p>risks, adjusted for age, sex, atrial fibrillation, co-morbidities and time trend comparing before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were estimated using Poisson regression.</p>
<p>Findings: Of 272,423 patients admitted with TE to 195 hospitals, 86,577 (31.8%) were admitted after 2nd March 2020 (first COVID-19 death in the UK). The incidence of TE hospitalised increased during the COVID-19 pandemic from 1090 to 1590 per 100,000 (absolute risk change 45.9% [95% CI 45.1 – 46.6%], adjusted rela-tive risk [ARR] 1.43 [95% CI 1.41 – 1.44]) driven particularly by pulmonary embolism; 1.49, 95% CI 1.46 – 1.52. TE were more frequent among those with COVID-19; 1.9% vs. 1.6%, absolute risk change 21.7%, 95% CI 21.0 – 22.4%, ARR 1.20, 95% CI 1.18 – 1.22. There was an increase in the overall mortality from TE during the pandemic (617, 6.7% proportional increase compared with the historical baseline), with more TE deaths occurring in the community compared with the historical rate (44% vs. 33%).</p>
<p>Interpretation: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increase in the incidence of hospitalised TE. There were more deaths from TE in the community highlighting a number of mechanisms including the hypercoagulable state associated with COVID-19 infection and potential impact of delays in seeking help.</p>
<h2>Research in context</h2>
<p>Evidence before this study</p>
<p>We searched PubMed on 16 November 2020 for articles that documented the incidence and mortality of thrombo-embolic events (TE) during the COVID-19 pandemic using the search terms “ COVID-19 ” OR “ Coro-navirus* ” OR “ 2019-nCOV ” OR “ SARS-CoV ” AND ( “ Thromboembolism ” OR “ Venous Thromboembolism ” OR</p>
<p>“ thromboembol* ” ) with no language or time restrictions. The majority of data on TE in COVID-19 pertains to hospitalised patients from retrospective cohort studies. One study found that TE in hospitalised patients was associated with an increased mortality rate (adjusted hazard ratio 1.82; 95% CI 1.54 – 2.15). A systematic review and meta-analysis of 35 studies in 9249 hospitalised patients calculated an overall pooled incidence of TE of 17.8% (95% CI: 9.9 – 27.4%), rising to 22.9% (95% CI: 14.5 – 32.4%) in patients admitted to intensive care (ICU). The most contemporary data are from a cohort of 1114 patients (715 outpatient, 399 hospitalised, 170 admitted to ICU). With robust COVID-19-specific therapies and widespread thromboprophylaxis the prevalence of venous TE in ICU patients was reported as 7% ( n = 12) when catheter-/device-related events were excluded, and among</p>

<p>the outpatients there was no TE reported. No published studies have used nationwide data to investigate TE during the pandemic or the effect of the pandemic on outcomes of patients with TE but without Covid-19. Added value of this study</p>
<p>This retrospective multi-sourced nationwide unlinked cohort study compares the overall incidence and mortality of TE prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found an increased incidence of TE despite only a small proportion having a diagnosis of COVID-19. This may highlight the lack of testing, particularly in the community during the initial phase of the pandemic, and the possibility of other factors contributing to TE risk, such as decreased daily activity mandated by home quarantine and alterations in medication concordance. Mortality from TE was higher in the community during the pandemic and this highlights that adverse societal effects of the pandemic, such as aversion to seeking medical assessment, may precipitate worse outcomes related to TE. Implications of all the available evidence</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that COVID-19 produces a hypercoagulable state and thromboprophylaxis is recommended in hospitalised patients to prevent excess mortality from TE. Whether to anticoagulate non-hospitalised ambulatory patients with COVID-19 will be answered by ongoing trials. Clinicians should consider the risks posed by decreased daily activity and fear of medical contact, and provide appropriate advice to patients.</p>

<h3>2.3. Statistical analyses</h3>
<p>This study aimed to investigate, using nationwide data from HES and the Civil Registration Deaths Data in England, the patterns of change in</p>
<p>Baseline characteristics were described using numbers and percent -</p>
<p>admissions with different phenotypes of TE, as well as the causes and</p>

<p>from all admissions in the corresponding day for the previous two years and compared this with the proportion of TE admissions from all ad-missions in the corresponding day from 2nd March 2020. This date was chosen for the time series comparison because it corresponded to the first COVID-19 death in the UK.</p>
<p>Incidence rates for admission with TE were standardised per 100,000</p>

<p>simple moving average (the mean number of daily deaths for that day</p>
<p>administrative and patient information of all patients admitted to any</p>
<p>and the preceding 6 days) from 1st February up to 31st July, adjusted for</p>

<p>the COVID-19 pandemic).</p>
<p>included only the index hospitalisations for TE during the study period</p>
<p>For the categories of TE death, the ICD-10 code on the MCCD was</p>
<p>in the analysis; to avoid analysing replicate events for the same patient,</p>
<p>counted only once per deceased. Thus, the overall rate of TE death</p>
<p>re-hospitalisations due to TE during the study period were excluded.</p>

<p>Admissions with TE were classified as arterial (including stroke and</p>
<p>of the fact that people may have had more than one of the predefined TE</p>
<p>arterial thromboembolic events), and venous (including pulmonary</p>

<p>(Table 2). While the most frequent manifestation of TE related to arterial</p>
<p>the COVID-19 pandemic up to the end of the period of analysis and the</p>
<p>pathologies, there was an increase in all types of TE. The largest increase</p>
<p>average total TE deaths in the same time period of 2018 and 2019.</p>

<p>The current study shows that while the mortality of TE declined in</p>
<p>compared with before the pandemic, suggesting that TE most affect</p>

<p>TE associated deaths in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection</p>
<p>substantial increase in PE incidence observed in our study, as well as</p>
<p>are likely to be underestimated in our study given the lack of testing</p>
<p>that previously reported in venous TE in the context of COVID-19</p>
<p>during the early phases of the pandemic [31,32], and the reliance on</p>
<p>despite the use of thromboprophylaxis [6,24].</p>
<p>ONS data [37]. However, the observed increase in TE mortality in non-</p>
<p>Previous studies have described the incidence and outcomes of TE in</p>
<p>COVID patients highlights the potential indirect repercussions of the</p>
<p>patients hospitalised with confirmed COVID-19 infection [6,25 – 29]. Our</p>
<p>pandemic on TE management and outcomes. While these findings may</p>
<p>study extends this knowledge by comparing the overall incidence and</p>
<p>be explained by insufficient detection and diagnosis of COVID-19</p>
<p>mortality of TE prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as</p>
<p>infection, other factors may have contributed. That is, sub-optimal</p>
<p>by COVID-19 status. Infection with the SARS-COV-2 virus was associ -</p>
<p>treatment of non-COVID patients at risk of TE because of the pressures</p>
<p>ated with an increase in TE - supporting the notion of COVID-19</p>
<p>of the pandemic on healthcare services, and the late presentation to</p>
<p>precipitating a prothrombotic state [12,30]. Yet, we also found an</p>
<p>hospital of patients with TE will have adversely affected prognosis [15].</p>

<p>Although our study has many strengths, it nonetheless has some</p>
<p>capture non-fatal TE that occurred during the hospital stay for patients</p>
<p>limitations. The exclusion of ICD codes for ACS may have resulted in an</p>
<p>admitted with a non-TE illness during the pandemic.</p>
<p>underestimation for the overall impact of the COVID-19 on the incidence of TE. However, given that these data have been previously described</p>
<h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
<p>[15], we opted to present here the rates of venous TE, as well as other</p>
<p>non-coronary arterial TE during the pandemic. Another limitation is that</p>
<p>This nationwide analysis of hospitalisations and deaths from TE</p>
<p>non-fatal TE that did not lead to hospitalisation were not captured in our</p>
<p>during the COVID-19 pandemic found an increase in the incidence of all</p>
<p>study. The MCCD were completed by any doctor (not just the attending</p>
<p>phenotypes of TE, particularly PE and a rise of TE-related deaths in the</p>
<p>doctor) during the COVID-19 pandemic and the duration of time over</p>
<p>community. The increased incidence of TE during the pandemic and</p>
<p>which the deceased was not seen before referral to the coroner was</p>
<p>with COVID-19 infection, which appeared not to be associated with</p>
<p>extended from 14 to 28 days. Moreover the documentation of causes of</p>
<p>people having different co-morbidities, suggests a hypercoagulable state</p>
<p>death could be ‘to the best of their knowledge and belief ’ without</p>
<p>associated with the infection. The rise in death in the community during</p>
<p>diagnostic proof, if appropriate and to avoid delay [38]. This may have</p>
<p>the pandemic, compared with previous years, highlights possible fears</p>
<p>resulted in misclassification bias, with under-reporting of the deaths</p>
<p>around or delays in seeking help.</p>
<p>directly due to TE disease in preference to COVID-19 infection (which is a notifiable disease under the Health Protection (Notification) Regula -</p>
<p>Data sharing statement</p>
<p>tions 2010) or respiratory disease. Our analysis will have excluded a small proportion of deaths under review by the coroner, though typi -</p>
<p>We used routinely collected data from electronic health records</p>
<p>cally these will have been unnatural in aetiology. Equally, coding of TE</p>
<p>using HES data to obtain information about TE hospitalisation, and</p>
<p>in HES may be inaccurate, and our study may have under-estimated the</p>
<p>death register to obtain mortality data. The ICD codes used are provided</p>
<p>incidence of TE. That is because we only included TE at the principle or</p>
<p>in the supplementary material. Data used for this study will be available</p>
