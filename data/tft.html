<p>The stabilization and control of the electrical properties in solution-processed amorphous-oxide semiconductors (AOSs) is crucial for the realization of cost-effective, high-performance, large-area electronics. In particular, impurity diffusion, electrical instability, and the lack of a general substitutional doping strategy for the active layer hinder the industrial implementation of copper electrodes and the fine tuning of the electrical parameters of AOS-based thin-film transistors (TFTs). In this study, the authors employ a multifunctional organic-semiconductor (OSC) interlayer as a solution-processed thin-film passivation layer and a charge-transfer dopant. As an electrically active impurity blocking layer, the OSC interlayer enhances the electrical stability of AOS TFTs by suppressing the adsorption of environmental gas species and copper-ion diffusion. Moreover, charge transfer between the organic inter-layer and the AOS allows the fine tuning of the electrical properties and the passivation of the electrical defects in the AOS TFTs. The development of a multifunctional solution-processed organic interlayer enables the production of low-cost, high-performance oxide semiconductor-based circuits. [4]</p>
<p>Increasing demands for next-generation, large-area electronics have motivated significant research efforts toward the devel-opment of new semiconductors and innovative processing techniques for thin-film transistors (TFTs) with high electrical performance, multifunctionalities, and a low fabrication cost. High-performance, low-cost multifunctional TFTs have been successfully demonstrated with newly emerging semiconduc-tors (organic semiconductors (OSCs), carbon materials (carbon nanotubes, graphene, C ), oxide semiconductors, etc.) and low-cost solution-processing methods (spin-coating, ink-jet printing, spray-coating, etc.) for flexible electronics, transparent electronics, and optoelectronics applications.

<p>various semiconductors, sputter-deposited amorphous indium–gallium–zinc oxide (a-IGZO) TFTs have been successfully implemented as the backplane compo-nent of fast-switching high-resolution displays and high current-driven organic light-emitting diode displays because of their high electrical performance (electron</p>

<p>In spite of the superior intrinsic elec-trical performance of a-IGZO TFTs, the efficient passivation of the channel layer from extrinsic impu-rities and the facile electrical-property control of these devices must be overcome for further applications in low-cost, large-area electronics, such as displays, sensor arrays, and printed logic circuits. For instance, copper-ion diffusion in TFTs with copper electrodes is a critical issue for the reduction of the RC delay, which is crucial for the realization of TFT circuits with a high switching speed. Copper ions migrate into the oxide-semiconductor channel layer because of electrical or thermal stresses, which results in the significant electrical performance degradation of metal-oxide semiconductor TFTs with copper electrodes.

<p>in metal-oxide semiconductors cause hump-like behavior in the transfer characteristics, as well as electrical instabilities of TFTs. Refractory metal-based barrier layers have been depos-ited between the copper electrode and metal oxide via expensive sputtering deposition. Novel barrier layers preventing copper diffusion fabricated by low-cost solution deposition should be developed for next-generation large-area electronics. The doping-level control of oxide semiconductors is crucial for achieving the proper turn-on voltage and Ohmic-contact formation in TFT devices. However, the electronic proper-ties of amorphous-oxide semiconductors (AOSs) are poorly controlled by conventional doping methods because the lack of structural ordering in AOSs prohibits the implementation of typical substitutional doping. Alternatively, shallow donor states arising from oxygen vacancies in AOSs gener-ally allow the control of the free-electron concentration, but the inevitable generation of deep trap states from the vacan-cies induce electrical-performance degradation in TFTs, such as a low electron mobility and bias instability. Moreover, the adsorption of ambient molecules (H O, O , etc.) on the oxygen vacancies in AOSs induces defect states, degrading the elec-trical performance and stability of AOS-based TFTs. Various passivation layers, such as dielectric oxides (SiO and Al O3 ), SiN , and composite materials, have been investigated for the x stabilization of a-IGZO TFTs against environmental effects. Unfortunately, the aforementioned inorganic passivation layers typically based on plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition may degrade the electrical properties of AOSs because of the plasma-induced radiation damage to the channel region. There-fore, investigation of an effective passivation layer—formed by a soft processing method—that can control the electrical prop-erties of oxide TFTs without composition tuning is essential for achieving reliable AOS-based TFTs.</p>

<p>In this regard, we report OSC interfacial layers (IFLs) with multifunctionality for AOS-based TFTs. By employing OSC IFLs prepared via a simple solution process, we successfully prevented copper-ion migration into the AOS, controlled the electrical properties of the AOS, and passivated the AOS from environmental effects and electrical stress. Furthermore, the contact resistance caused by OSC IFLs was reduced by the molecular doping of the OSCs.</p>
<p>Figure 1 a shows a schematic of the effective channel passivation of a-IGZO with OSC IFLs. Because the metal electrodes with a low resistivity, which form Ohmic contacts with the a-IGZO semiconductor, are essential for a high-performance TFT circuit, various metals (Al, Cu, Ag, Au, and Mo) and con-ducting oxides (a-IZO, ITO, In O ) have been investigated as potential electrodes for a-IGZO TFTs. In particular, copper is considered as the most suitable candidate for the electrodes, considering that its resistivity (1.7 μΩ cm) is comparable to that of silver (1.6 μΩ cm), while it is 100 times cheaper than silver. To prevent the significant electrical-performance deg-radation of AOS-based TFTs with copper electrodes, the copper ion-blocking layer should physically or chemically hinder the ion migration. Refractory metals with high melting points, such as Mn, W, Ta, and Mo, have been employed as a barrier layer between the copper electrode and the metal-oxide semicon-ductor. For instance, zinc-tin-oxide (ZTO) TFTs with a tantalum barrier film for copper source/drain (S/D) electrodes showed an improved subthreshold swing (SS) and electron mobility. Unfortunately, the rigid physical barrier due to refractory-metal IFLs inherently requires expensive sputtering deposition and is incompatible with low-cost solution-processing methods. In general, π -electron rich species can be considered as soft bases, which can interact strongly with soft-acid species, such as low-valent transition-metal cations and heavy-metal cations.</p>
<p>Unlike the case of typical copper ion-blocking layers made of physically dense refractory metals, strong chemical binding between Cu and π -electron-rich OSC can effectively prevent the penetration of copper ions into the channel layer of AOSs. As shown in Figure 1a, the adsorption of ambient chemical species is the critical issue for the realization of electrically stable high-performance solution-processed AOS-based TFTs. Environmental species such as oxygen and water are easily adsorbed on the oxygen-vacancy sites in the oxide semicon-ductors. During the oxygen-molecule adsorption on oxide semiconductors, electrons in the conduction band of the semi-</p>
<p>− −</p>
<p>conductor are transferred to oxygen, forming O or O . Con-2 sequently, a depletion layer is formed under the oxide surface, shifting the threshold voltage ( V ) in TFTs. In contrast to</p>
<p>th</p>
<p>oxygen molecules, water molecules act as donors in oxide semi-conductors, changing the electrical properties of TFTs. As an environmental species-blocking layer, the soft OSC can fill the empty coordination sites of the metal cation (i.e., oxygen vacancies) in AOSs via strong interactions with the soft metal (indium), suppressing the facile adsorption of water and oxygen on the vacancy sites of AOSs. Moreover, the hydrophobic nature of OSCs can hinder the adsorption of water on the AOSs. Overall, thin OSC IFLs are efficient for blocking copper migration as well as contamination by external ambient species that significantly degrade the elec-trical performance and stability of oxide sem-iconductor-based TFTs.</p>
<p>In addition to the passivation of oxide semiconductors, OSC IFLs can be applied to control the electrical properties of AOSs. Recent reports on the charge-transfer doping and the band alignment between a crys-talline oxide semiconductor and organic materials provide avenues for controlling the electrical properties of AOSs without electrical-performance degradation. The charge transfer at the organic–inorganic heterojunction has been extensively inves-tigated to achieve efficient charge collection or insertion with OSCs. Figure 1b and Figure S1 (Supporting Information) show the electronic structure of a-IGZO and OSC IFLs including small molecules (phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester: PCBM) and a polymer (poly{[ N , N ′ -bis(2-octyldodecyl)- naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6- diyl]-alt-5,5 ′ -(2,2 ′ -bithiophene)}: N2200). Considering the universality of charge-transfer phenomena between inorganic and OSCs, diverse OSCs can be applied to tune the electrical properties of oxide semicon-ductors and even AOSs.</p>

In contrast, the transfer characteristics of the a-IGZO TFTs with PCBM IFLs afforded an electrically stable TFT device (Figure 2b and Table S2, Supporting Information). Unlike the large negative V shift</p>

<p>induced by copper-ion migration in the reference device, the small positive V shift for the devices with OSC IFLs reveals</p>
<p>th</p>
<p>that the copper-ion migration is negligible in a-IGZO with OSC IFLs (Table S2, Supporting Information). The stability of OSC IFL-based TFTs is also confirmed by the field-dependent transfer characteristics (Figure S4, Supporting Information). As shown, copper-ion migration was observed for a-IGZO TFTs without OSC IFLs as V was increased from 1 to 100 V.</p>
<p>DS</p>
<p>For a-IGZO reference TFTs (with channel length of 25 μ m), copper-ion migration is clearly observed as humplike behavior</p>

<p>at V &gt; 90 V (3.6 MV m ) (Figure S4a, Supporting Informa-</p>

<p>tion), as reported in the literature. On the other hand, a-IGZO TFTs with OSC IFLs exhibited stable device operation without any humplike behavior (Figure S4b,c, Supporting Information). The OSC IFLs sufficiently blocked the copper-ion movement via the chemical interaction between the copper ions and the OSC. According to the hard soft acid base (HSAB) theory, Cu can be considered as a soft acid, which can strongly interact with a soft base, such as lone pairs of electrons on S and P atoms and delo-calized π -electrons in the OSCs. Similar electrical stability was observed for a-IGZO devices with other OSC IFLs, such as the n-type polymer N2200 (Figures S4c and S5a, Supporting Information). The SIMS spectra of Cu/PCBM/a-IGZO/Si and Cu/a-IGZO/Si multilayer structures indicate that copper-ion penetration was effectively suppressed (Figure 2c,d). To facili-tate copper-ion penetration into the oxide-semiconductor layer, the multilayer structures were heated at 150 ° C for 60 min. The SIMS signal of the a-IGZO reference device shown in Figure 2c indicates that the copper signal was consistently detected with indium and gallium signals. Without the OSC IFLs, the copper ions penetrated into the whole a-IGZO layer, down to the oxide–silicon interface. On the other hand, copper ions could not penetrate into the a-IGZO layer when the PCBM layer was inserted as a blocking layer (Figure 2d). Overall, the OSC IFLs effectively blocked the copper-ion diffusion, not only under electrical stress but also under harsh heating conditions. The efficient barrier property of the OSC IFLs against ambient species, such as water and oxygen, was also confirmed (Figure 2e,f). Transfer curves of the a-IGZO reference device show a large negative shift of the curves with the environ-mental change from ambient to vacuum (Figure 2e), which is mainly attributed to the desorption of water and oxygen from</p>
<p>the semiconductor. The thin PCBM layer effectively blocked the adsorption of water and oxygen on the a-IGZO. In contrast to the large V shift of − 7.21 V for the a-IGZO reference device</p>

<p>(Figure 2e), the device with PCBM IFLs exhibited a negligible transfer-curve shift with a V shift of − 0.43 V (Figure 2f).</p>

<p>Regardless of the environment in which the measurements were performed, similar stable transfer curves of devices with N2200 IFLs were measured, as shown in Figure S5b (Sup-porting Information) In addition, the implementation of</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>PCBM IFL into a-ZTO TFT devices showed the stable electrical performance under air and vacuum (Figure S6, Supporting Information), which confirmed that the OSC IFL could be gen-erally applicable for various oxide semiconductors. As shown in Figure 3 a, and Figure S7 and Tables S1 and S4 in the Supporting Information, the multifunctionality of the OSC interlayer was utilized to tune the electrical characteristic of the AOSs. Figure S7 and Table S1 (Supporting Information) show that the V values shifted to negative values as the work</p>

<p>function of the OSC decreased. Because PCBM and N2200, as well-known n-type OSCs with low lowest-unoccupied-molecular-orbital levels, allowed electron transfer from OSCs to a-IGZO, the Δ V values of the a-IGZO TFT devices were</p>
<p>on</p>
<p>− 20 and − 15 V for PCBM and N2200, respectively. As shown in Figure 1b, the PCBM has a smaller work function than the N2200, which facilitates electron transfer into the IGZO layer, resulting in larger Δ V values On the other hand, as shown</p>
<p>on .</p>
<p>in Figures S1 and S8 in the Supporting Information, electrical characteristics of the a-IGZO TFT are quite consistent regard-less of the thickness of PCBM IFL above critical thickness ( ≈ 10 nm). However, because the IFL needs to act as a barrier to the atmospheric environment, the IFLs for all the TFT stability tests were deposited to a thickness of 34 nm. Considering the diverse electronic structures of OSCs, the electrical properties of AOSs should be tailored to targeted values using finely tuned organic materials. For instance, proper energy level of OSCs would ensure the passivation of electrical defect state within AOSs, while avoiding conducting oxide channel layer at the same time. Furthermore, high electron mobility of AOSs would be favorable for the efficient injection of electrons into channel layer in AOSs. Moreover, as observed in crystalline ZnO, the n-doping of OSC IFLs can be utilized to tune the electrical properties of a-IGZO. As shown in Figure 3a, the controlled doping of PCBM with 4-(1,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo-imidazol-2-yl)phenyl)dimethylamine (N-DMBI)—a solution-processable n-type dopant—could change the degree of doping in a-IGZO, regardless of its crystallinity. Notably, the important aspect of the n-doping of PCBM was observed with the signifi-cant reduction of the contact resistance between a-IGZO and PCBM (Figure 3b and Figure S9, Supporting Information). The output curves of a-IGZO TFTs with undoped OSC interlayer shown in Figure S9 in the Supporting Information exhibit a more suppressed shape in the low-voltage region than the refer-ence devices, which suggests a large contact resistance with the OSC IFL. By doping PCBM with N-DMBI, the contact resist-ance of the resulting device extracted by the well-known trans-mission line method (TLM) was decreased from 4.62 k Ω cm (without N-DMBI) to 0.43 k Ω cm (doped with 2% N-DMBI) because of the strongly n-doped interface between the PCBM and a-IGZO and the reduced bulk resistance of the PCBM and</p>

<p>th</p>
<p>spatially selectively doped PCBM IFLs/a-IGZO devices with a thermally evaporated N-DMBI dopant, as shown in Figure 3c. The thickness of the deposited N-DMBI was 2 nm, which cor-responds to about 6 wt% doping for PCBM of 34 nm thickness when treated with thermal diffusion process. Doping concen-tration was enough to induce metallic contact, as reported in previous studies. As shown in Figure 3d,e, and Figure S11d in the Supporting Information, the selective doping of PCBM with N-DMBI in the S/D contact area did not shift the V</p>

<p>values compared with intrinsic PCBM, whereas the contact resistance was significantly reduced to 0.65 k Ω cm.</p>
<p>In addition to a high electron mobility and environmental stability, the intrinsic electrical stability of a-IGZO TFTs under electrical stress is crucial for the industrial implementation of solution-processed devices. Under the positive-bias-stress (PBS) condition, the oxygen adsorption on the back channel generates acceptor-like electron trap states. These states can be removed by applying an electron-donating passivation layer at the oxygen-binding sites. As previously mentioned, PCBM can function as a passivation layer for device stabilization without generating additional defects from harsh vacuum processing conditions. As shown in Figure 3f and Figure S12 in the Supporting Information, a-IGZO TFTs with copper elec-trodes kept under the PBS condition ( V = 25 V, V = 50 V)</p>

As expected, the OSC IFLs significantly enhanced the electrical bias stability of the a-IGZO TFT with copper electrodes under the PBS condition. After 3600 s under the same PBS condition, the a-IGZO TFT with a PCBM IFL exhibited a very small Δ V of 1.11 V, which is</p>

<p>comparable to that of vacuum-deposited a-IGZO.</p>
<p>Similar to</p>
<p>our results, the effect of an electron-donating defect-passivation layer was demonstrated with Y O , which is regarded as a basic metal oxide. Overall, the exceptional multifunctionality of OSC IFLs allows electrically and environmentally stable a-IGZO devices. After a PBS test under ambient conditions for 3600 s, the selectively doped PCBM IFL device exhibited a negligible</p>

<p>of these PCBM IFL devices to the ambient environment is con-sistent with previous reports in which DMBI also contributes to enhancing the air stability of PCBM. Considering the exceptional device stability of the a-IGZO with an inserted OSC IFL against chemical-species penetration and electrical stress, the solution-processed hybrid device with an OSC and AOS syner-gistically improves the electrical and environmental stabilities of solution-processed TFTs, which can enable the fabrication of low-cost and high-performance next-generation electronics. We demonstrated that OSC-based IFLs are a multifunctional material suitable for the tuning and optimization of high-performance AOS-based TFTs. Considering the diversity</p>
<p>of OSCs and universality of charge-transfer phenomena, 2 the OSC IFL-based organic-oxide hybrid structure is gener-ally applicable for the fine tuning of the electrical properties of AOSs, such as the turn-on voltage and contact resistance.

<p>Furthermore, a significant contact-resistance reduction from 4.62 to 0.43 k Ω cm was achieved with N-DMBI-doped PCBM. The OSC IFLs are excellent thin-film passivation layers for environmental species, ion diffusion, and electrical stress.

The synergetic combination of the intrinsic chemical proper-ties of the copper electrode, AOS, and OSC yielded electrically stable and high-performance hybrid devices. In summary, the solution-processed OSC interlayer provided a soft-passivation structure of a-IGZO (15 nm) on a conductive silicon substrate and method for the high-performance copper electrode-based PCBM (4–34 nm)/a-IGZO (15 nm) on a conductive silicon substrate a-IGZO.</p>

Copper S/D electrodes (thickness = 50 nm) were deposited by thermal evaporation using an aluminum shadow mask with a channel width of 1500 μ m and various channel lengths ranging from 25 to 350 μ m. For selective N-DMBI doping, N-DMBI was deposited onto IFL films by thermal deposition using a shadow mask. M. F. Toney, J. S. Huang, Z. N. Bao, Nat.
